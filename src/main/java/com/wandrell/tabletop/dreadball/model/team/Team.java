/**
 * Interface representing the basic features all the Dreadball teams have, no
 * matter if they come from DBO or DBX, serving as a root interface for both
 * games.
 * <p>
 * Due to the fact that the DBO and DBX unit interfaces differ, the {@code Team}
 * makes use of a template.
 * <p>
 * Among all the features the interface offers, which are mostly query methods,
 * the most important is the {@link #getValoration() getValoration} method, as
 * it allows acquiring the current value of said team.
 * <p>
 * The strategy to calculate the valoration will differ from DBO to DBX, but
 * basically it sums the valoration of each player and the cost of each asset
 * the team owns.
 * <p>
 * When assigning a player to the team it has to receive a numerical position on
 * it, which should be free, as no two players may share the same number.
