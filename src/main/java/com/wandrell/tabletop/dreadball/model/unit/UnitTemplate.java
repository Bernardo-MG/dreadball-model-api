/**
 * Interface representing the basic features all the Dreadball units have, no
 * matter if they come from Dreadball Original (DBO) or Dreadball Xtreme (DBX),
 * serving as a root interface for both games.
 * <p>
 * It should be noted that in Dreadball units are called 'players', as they are
 * players in a team, but to keep the API similar to that of other games they
 * will be called units.
 * <p>
 * The basic qualities any player have are the attributes, abilities and team
 * position. Along the basic initial cost, and a flag indicating if they are
 * giants or not.
 * <p>
 * The attributes are kept in an {@link AttributesHolder}, mostly to avoid
 * cluttering the interface.
 * <p>
 * The main use of this interface is representing the templates from which other
 * kind of units are created. Or to say the same, the profiles which appear on
 * the books. For this reason the {@code #getTemplateName() getTemplateName}
 * method is included, which will give the name of said template, that way it is
 * possible to know the base from which any unit has been created.
 * <p>
 * While this interface can be useful for querying such templates as immutable
 * instances, when possible it is recommended using any of the extensions
 * included in the library.
 * <p>
 * To handle the editable units of DBO the
 * {@link com.wandrell.tabletop.dreadball.model.unit.AdvancementUnit
 * AdvancementUnit} interface should be used. While for handling DBX units there
 * is the {@link com.wandrell.tabletop.dreadball.model.unit.AffinityUnit
 * AffinityUnit} interface.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, composite versions of these interfaces are offered in the
 * {@link com.wandrell.tabletop.dreadball.model.unit.component components}
 * package.
