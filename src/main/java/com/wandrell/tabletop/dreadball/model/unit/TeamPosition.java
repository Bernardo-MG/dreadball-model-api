/**
 * Enumeration for all the possible position roles in a Dreadball team.
 * <p>
 * These position roles have a big impact on the rules and game play, and all
 * the players have one assigned.
 * <p>
 * Most of the time there are three such roles: guard, jack and striker. Guards
 * and strikers are specialists, the first can't take the ball while the second
 * can't do offensive actions. Jacks don't have any limitation on the actions
 * they may do, but suffer a movement handicap when doing most actions.
 * <p>
 * A fourth role, the keeper, is very rare, as usually it is created from a
 * Guard or it is a MVP, a special unit. This role is a Guard which can take the
 * ball, albeit with heavy limitations.
 * <p>
 * These roles are meant to be used primarily by units, which are created from
 * the {@link com.wandrell.tabletop.dreadball.model.unit.UnitTemplate
 * UnitTemplate} root interface.
