/**
 * Interface representing the basic features all the Dreadball units have, no
 * matter if they come from DBO or DBX, serving as a root interface for both
 * games.
 * <p>
 * It should be noted that in Dreadball units are called 'players', as they are
 * players in a team, but to keep the model similar to that of other games they
 * will be called units.
 * <p>
 * The basic qualities any player have are the attributes, abilities and team
 * position.
 * <p>
 * Additionally they may be giants, which is not so common, but still is handled
 * by a flag which can be queried with the {@code #isGiant() isGiant} method.
 * <p>
 * As the interface may represent any kind of player it can also represent the
 * templates from which said players are created. Or to say the same, the
 * profiles which appear on the books. For this reason the
 * {@code #getTemplateName() getTemplateName} method is included, which will
 * give the name of said template. Something that may good to know in all units.
 * <p>
 * Said templates also have a basic cost, which can be queried with the
 * {@link #getCost() getCost} method.
 * <p>
 * The interface is immutable, to handle editable units use the
 * {@link com.wandrell.tabletop.dreadball.model.unit.AdvancementUnit
 * AdvancementUnit} interface. Another interface for units, the
 * {@link com.wandrell.tabletop.dreadball.model.unit.AffinityUnit AffinityUnit}
 * is for those units which have a price depending on affinities.
