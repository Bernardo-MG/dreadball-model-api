 * These are for Dreadball Xtreme (DBX), but are very similar to the ones for
 * Dreadball Original (DBO), even sharing some like the Coaching Die.
 * <p>
 * The biggest difference is conceptual, as these assets are mostly meant to be
 * bought with an allowance equal to the {@code Sponsor} rank. And also there is
 * not a maximum number of times they can be bought. After all, raising the
 * {@code Sponsor} rank is hard.
 * <p>
 * The interface includes, just for avoid adding an additional interface, a
 * method for finding out the minimal amount of money a {@code Sponsor} should
 * expend on a team.
