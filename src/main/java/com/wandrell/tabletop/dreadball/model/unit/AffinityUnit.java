/**
 * Interface extension for {@link UnitTemplate} representing one with affinities
 * groups, and various costs depending on affinities levels.
 * <p>
 * These are DBX units, where both the units and the sponsor trying to buy them
 * have affinities groups. Depending on how many they share the affinity level,
 * and so the price, will vary.
 * <p>
 * There is also a special kind of affinities, the hated affinities. If a type
 * of unit hates an affinity group, then no sponsor with that affinity may hire
 * those units.
 * <p>
 * The {@code getCost} method from the parent interface is meant to store the
 * cost at which the unit has been acquired, and is not expected to indicate
 * which of the three affinity costs is the one to be applied, but may do so,
 * depending on the implementation.
 * <p>
 * It should be noted that this interface makes sense when calculating the cost
 * a unit will have for a sponsor. Once it has been found, then it may be better
 * to revert to the basic {@code Unit}.
