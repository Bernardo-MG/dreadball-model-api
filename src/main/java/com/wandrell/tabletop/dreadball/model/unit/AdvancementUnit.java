 * Interface extension for {@link Unit} representing one which may advance and

 * <p>
 * These are the DBO players which can improve after a game, mainly by gaining
 * experience and increasing his level, but can also deteriorate, for example by
 * using the cheap revival option.
 * <p>
 * For this the interface makes the basic {@link Unit} mutable, allowing any
 * kind of modification, but also adds support for unspent experience points and
 * rank, which stands for the player's level.
 * <p>
 * Said level is meant to be handled as part of the team customization
 * mechanics, and the {@code Unit} will just hold all the required information
 * for this.
