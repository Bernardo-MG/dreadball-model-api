/**
 * Interface extension for {@link UnitTemplate} representing a unit which may
 * change and evolve between matches.
 * <p>
 * These are the Dreadball Original (DBO) units. Mainly they improve by gaining
 * experience and increasing ranks, which equal to the unit level, but they may
 * also deteriorate, for example by using the cheap revival option (which will
 * remove experience), or improve in other special ways, such as acquiring an
 * implant.
 * <p>
 * To allow such changes the interface makes the basic {@link UnitTemplate}
 * mutable, allowing any kind of modification. And also adds methods to track
 * the changes and advancement.
 * <p>
 * It should be noted that increasing the rank consumes experience, and there
 * are some additional limitations, such as only allowing a single rank raise
 * between games. This can't be tracked easily by implementations of the
 * interface, and for this reason it is expected to be handled externally. Units
 * are expected to only store the experience and rank, and not work with them,
 * making these attributes devoid of business logic.
 * <p>
 * On the other hand, there is the unit valoration. As the unit evolves its cost
 * increases. This is handled through a simple formula, which consists on adding
 * the cost of the improvements to the basic cost, the same cost which can be
 * queried with {@link #getCost()}. The resulting unit valoration can be checked
 * with the {@link #getValoration() getValoration} method, and all logic
 * required for such calculation is expected to be handled by the
 * implementation.
