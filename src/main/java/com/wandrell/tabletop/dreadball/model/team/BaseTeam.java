/**
 * Interface representing the basic features all the Dreadball teams have, no
 * matter if they come from Dreadball Original (DBO) or Dreaball Xtreme (DBX),
 * serving as a root interface for both games.
 * <p>
 * It is not meant to be used by itself, instead any of the interfaces
 * overriding this should be used.
 * <p>
 * Due to the fact that the DBO and DBX unit interfaces differ, the {@code Team}
 * makes use of a template, which will reflect the actual unit being used.
 * <p>
 * Among all the features the interface offers, which are mostly query methods,
 * the most important is the {@link #getValoration() getValoration} method, as
 * it allows acquiring the current value of said team.
 * <p>
 * The strategy to calculate the valoration basically is calculating the sum of
 * the valoration of each player and the cost of each asset the team owns. All
 * the business logic required for this is expected to be handled by
 * implementations of the interface.
 * <p>
 * When assigning a player to the team it has to receive a numerical position in
 * it, which should be unassigned, as no two players may share the same number.
