# Units

## MVPs

MVPs, which are the game's heroes and mercenaries, are a special case of unit. But the thing is that they only have importance, taking into consideration the model's scope, during the team creation procedure.

For this reason the unit interfaces won't handle them, and this job instead will be taken care by the availabilities interfaces.
